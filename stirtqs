Macro & Policy

“When you look at current OIS pricing, do you think the market is too aggressive in cutting relative to the BoE’s communication?”

“Which data releases move the front-end most reliably these days — is it still CPI and AWE, or have PMIs and services data gained more weight?”

“How do you balance the BoE’s stated reaction function with market expectations of imported inflation via GBP weakness?”

🛠️ Market Structure

“How much do repo dynamics and collateral conditions bleed into how SONIA trades at the very front-end?”

“Do you think SONIA futures are still the cleanest way to express a macro view, or have meeting-dated OIS swaps become more liquid for tactical trading?”

“When the APF sells gilts and reserves shrink, how does that change your view on the stability of SONIA fixings?”

📈 Curve & Relative Value

“Do you see more opportunity in trading outright BoE meeting risk, or in relative value across the strip (e.g., reds vs greens)?”

“How do you think about GBP front-end vs EUR — does the ECB’s faster easing bias create attractive relative trades in the belly?”

“Are there situations where the SONIA strip is ‘over-hedged’ by real money, creating good risk-reward to fade consensus positioning?”

🎲 Risk & Trading Process

“When you’re running risk around CPI or MPC day, how do you size positions — is it more about optionality or running small outright delta?”

“How do you avoid getting chopped up by intraday volatility in STIRT, where every tick can move on headlines?”

“What role do options (swaptions, cap/floors) play in complementing your risk around the front-end?”

✅ These questions show you understand:

STIRT is data + BoE reaction function + micro plumbing (SONIA, repo, reserves).

They think in terms of event risk + relative value + positioning.

Would you like me to also prepare trader-style one-liners you can say before asking the question (e.g., “With CPI surprising to the downside but wages still sticky, it feels like the front-end is torn between stagflation and disinflation. How do you think about that when trading the SONIA strip?”)? Those framing lines make you sound like you’re already speaking their language.

these questions arent clever enough

Got it — you’re right. A STIRT trader will find “what moves the front-end” too surface-level. You want to sound like you understand microstructure, relative value, and policy path convexity. Let’s sharpen them into properly clever, trader-style questions that would make you stand out.

🧠 Clever, Nuanced Questions for a STIRT Trader
🔄 Curve Dynamics & BoE Path

“With the SONIA strip now pricing a shallow cutting cycle, how do you think about the convexity of meeting-dated pricing — i.e., whether the market is underestimating the tails of a faster/slower path?”
→ Shows you know traders care about distribution, not just mean path.

“Do you see more edge trading relative value across meetings — like May vs Aug MPC contracts — rather than the outright level of cuts?”
→ Signals you understand event-spread trades are a STIRT bread-and-butter.

📊 Cross-Market & Basis

“How do you think about GBP/EUR front-end divergence trades, given the ECB is already easing faster — is the trade more about central bank divergence or about relative terminal rates?”
→ Shows awareness of cross-market RV.

“With SONIA firmly established, do you still see any dislocations between SONIA futures and OIS, or between SONIA and GC repo?”
→ That’s plumbing-level clever — they’ll know you’ve thought about curve construction.

🛠️ Technical Microstructure

“When APF gilt sales drain reserves, SONIA stays anchored — but do you worry about fixings becoming more volatile as reserves fall, or is the new repo-based framework insulating you?”
→ Links BoE balance sheet → SONIA microstructure.

“How much weight do you give to collateral scarcity at quarter-ends or coupon dates when thinking about SONIA strips — can these technicals create tactical RV trades?”
→ This is exactly the kind of STIRT-specific nuance they’ll appreciate.

⚖️ Risk & Positioning

“When you take risk into CPI or AWE releases, do you think about it more in terms of options-like convexity — e.g., getting paid for the tails — rather than just delta?”
→ Clever because it hints you understand event convexity matters more than outright directional bets.

“Do you notice systematic positioning in the strip — like real money consistently over-hedging the reds — and how do you decide when that positioning becomes a fade opportunity?”
→ This is the kind of flow-aware cleverness traders like.

🌍 Big Picture Integration

“When the front-end reprices aggressively after US CPI or Fed minutes, how do you judge whether GBP is genuinely mis-aligned with BoE dynamics versus just a global beta move?”
→ Shows you know GBP front-end is often dragged by global rates.

“Do you see UK stagflation risk as creating asymmetric risk in the strip — i.e., limited room for cuts to be priced in, but much more room for them to be priced out?”
→ Phrased in trader-language: asymmetry.
