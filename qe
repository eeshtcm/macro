Awesome idea to link your auction‑concession findings to the “supply regime” and QE/QT backdrop. Here’s a clean, trader‑friendly timeline for the last ~5 fiscal years (with the numbers you’ll want when you explain moves in ASW/curve‑concession), plus how to use it in your analysis.

What “supply regime” + QE/QT” means (quick defs)

Supply regime = how much gilt duration the DMO put into the market and where on the curve (short/med/long/index‑linked), by method (auctions, syndications, tenders), and any revisions. Bigger or front‑loaded issuance → more concession risk around auctions/syndications in the targeted bucket.

QE/QT = how much duration the BoE took out of (QE) or put back into (QT) private hands via the Asset Purchase Facility (APF). Active APF sales + non‑reinvestment of maturities raise net supply and can steepen/cheapens ASW/curve in the affected sectors.

Year‑by‑year: the numbers that matter
FY 2020/21 (COVID shock; maximal QE; record gilt supply)

DMO plan: £485.5bn gilt sales (record). 
GOV.UK

QE: 19 Mar 2020 +£200bn (Bank Rate to 0.1%); 18 Jun 2020 +£100bn; 5 Nov 2020 +£150bn → total gilts target ~£875bn (APF ~£895bn including corporates).

Concession link: massive buying by APF offset supply; pre‑auction concession often modest vs issuance size because QE was absorbing duration.

FY 2021/22 (supply still heavy, QE winds down)

DMO plan: initially £295.9bn, revised during the year (ultimately lowered; Oct‑21 revision steered to £194.8bn).

QE: net purchases tapered; net purchases ceased March 2022. 
Department for Media and Offshore

Concession link: less BoE absorption; watch medium/long auctions for bigger pre‑auction concession relative to 2020/21.

FY 2022/23 (start of QT; LDI episode)

DMO plan: £124.7bn initially → £193.9bn after the Sept 2022 “Growth Plan” revision → £169.5bn after the Nov 2022 Autumn Statement.

QT: Feb 2022 the MPC stopped reinvesting and set up corporate‑bond sales; gilt active sales scheduled for Q4‑2022 (later delayed during turmoil). 
GOV.UK
Bank of England

LDI crisis: 28 Sep–14 Oct 2022 temporary gilt purchases (incl. linkers 11–14 Oct), ~£19.3bn total, to restore market functioning; then unwound.

Concession link: regime was chaotic—revisions pushed more issuance, while QT lifted net supply; LDI stress forced BoE temporary buying that briefly reduced concession/cheapness in the affected tenors.

FY 2023/24 (regular QT; still‑high issuance)

DMO plan: £241.1bn at Budget → £237.8bn (Apr outturn tweak) → £237.3bn (Nov revision). 
Department for Media and Offshore
+1

QT: MPC set reduction of ~£100bn over Oct‑2023 to Sep‑2024 (mix of maturities rolling off + sales). By 31 Jan 2024 the APF gilt stock (at purchase price) was down to ~£738bn from £875bn at the start of QT; corporate bond portfolio essentially gone.

Concession link: with no QE bid and steady QT, net private‑sector supply rose—supportive of pre‑auction cheapening (especially in buckets the DMO emphasized).

FY 2024/25 (largest net supply to private hands since records, because QT + bigger remit)

DMO plan: £265.3bn at Budget → £277.7bn (Apr) → £296.9bn (Oct revision).

Mix shifts: long share set to the lowest for years as DMO leaned more to short/medium (reflecting demand/pension fund dynamics).

Green‑gilt programme continued (total raised since 2021 noted in DMR).

QT: MPC extended another £100bn reduction over Oct‑2024 to Sep‑2025; only ~£13bn of that via active sales, the rest from maturities.

Concession link: this is the textbook “heavy net supply” year—issuance near‑record + QT → expect larger and more persistent concessions, strongest in the buckets DMO was issuing most (short/med), unless risk appetite or LDI‑type technicals dominate.

How to use this in your analytics (practical checklist)

Build a daily “net duration supply” series
For each business day, approximate:

Net_supply = DMO_auctions_duration
            + DMO_syndications_duration
            + BoE_QT_sales_duration
            + BoE_maturity_non‑reinvestment_duration
            – BoE_QE_purchases_duration (if any)


Use the remit calendars and APF schedules to tag dates. Revisions (Sep‑22, Nov‑22, Apr‑/Oct‑24) are structural breaks to include as dummies.

Map issuance to curve buckets
Short/med/long/index‑linked split each year drives where concession should show up (your “Long / Mid / Short” charts). The 2024/25 mix (more short/med) should bias concession there.

Overlay with your concession panel

For each auction, compute pre‑T(‑k) concession and see if it covaries with cumulative scheduled issuance over the same window and with QT flow into that window.

A simple regression you can run per bucket:

Concession_i,t  ~  α
                + β1 * Cum_issuance_in_bucket_(t-k..t-1)
                + β2 * QT_flow_(t-k..t-1)
                + β3 * “revision” dummies
                + β4 * curve_controls (2s10s, 10s30s)
                + ε


Sign of β1, β2 should be positive if “more net supply ⇒ cheaper (more concession)” matches your plots.

How to “link to your results”

When you present your concession plots:

Add a bottom panel with the weekly net‑supply bars (DMO issuance ± APF sales/maturities).

Annotate remit revisions and LDI window with vertical bands.

For each auction point, print a tiny label with the same‑bucket issuance in the prior week and the sign/magnitude of QT flow.

That makes it obvious when your concession f(t) lines are reacting to “more paper coming” (or “no BoE bid”).
