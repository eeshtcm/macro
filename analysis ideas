1. Auction Quality vs. Price Action

Idea: Link pre-/post-auction concession to actual auction outcomes:

Tail size (difference between stop yield and WI).

Bid-to-cover ratio.

Allotment to GEMMs vs. clients.

Why it’s clever: It tests whether concession really predicts auction strength.

Trader angle: “If concession is large but the auction still tails, maybe dealers were over-distributing risk.”

📈 2. Volatility-Adjusted Concession

Idea: Express concession not in bp, but in standard deviations of recent volatility.

Why it’s clever: Puts quiet and volatile regimes on the same footing.

Trader angle: “Is a 2bp concession in shorts in a calm week more meaningful than a 5bp concession in a choppy week?”

🔄 3. Relative Value Across Segments

Idea: Compare concessions across shorts vs. longs vs. ultras within the same issuance window.

Why it’s clever: Tests whether supply in one part of the curve spills over into others.

Trader angle: “Do long auctions cheapen the 10y sector, or is the effect contained?”

🌍 4. Cross-Market Supply Effects

Idea: Look at Bund / OAT auction weeks vs. gilt concession.

Why it’s clever: Tests whether supply pressure is global, not just UK.

Trader angle: “Does heavy Bund supply cheapen gilts through RV players?”

📊 5. Regime Dependence

Idea: Split analysis into periods:

Rising rate environment vs. cutting environment.

High vs. low BOE balance sheet activity (QT).

Why it’s clever: Shows whether concession dynamics change with macro backdrop.

Trader angle: “Should we expect weaker concession persistence when the BOE is actively in the market?”

⚡ 6. Intraday Extension (bonus if time)

Idea: Use high-frequency (hourly) data to see when during auction day concession starts reversing.

Why it’s clever: Connects to execution timing.

Trader angle: “Do you lean into post-auction rallies straight away, or only in the afternoon session?”

🔐 7. Flow Proxies

Idea: Overlay client flow data (if available) or GEMM distribution (public from DMO) with concession.

Why it’s clever: Ties supply/demand balance directly to observed pricing.

Trader angle: “Was this concession client-driven or dealer positioning?”

🧠 8. Concession Persistence Forecast

Idea: Fit a simple regression:

F1 concession = α + β * P3 concession


Why it’s clever: Turns the correlation fan into a predictive model.

Trader angle: “If pre-auction cheapening is 3bp, we expect ~2bp persistence into F1.”

🚀 How to Pitch This in Your Presentation

At the end of your core slides, add:
“Next Steps / Extensions”

Auction outcomes (tail, bid-to-cover).

Vol-adjusted concessions.

Cross-market spillovers.

Regime splits (rates rising vs. falling).

That makes you look like you thought beyond what they asked, but didn’t over-engineer.

👉 Do you want me to pick 2–3 of these extensions and actually write the Python code so you have something to show (even if just partial results)? That way you can say: “I went beyond the brief and tested X.”

im confused what findings i would actually present - can you give examples
ChatGPT said:

Yes — let’s make this concrete. Imagine you’ve run the concession analysis (outright, curve, ASW) on all your gilt data and lined it up with the DMO auction calendar. What would you actually say when presenting findings? Here are realistic examples of “findings” you could put in your slides:

🔑 Examples of Findings to Present
1. Outright Concession Patterns

“On average, 5y and 10y gilts cheapen by ~2–3bp in the 5 trading days before an auction.”

“Concession is more pronounced in short maturities (sub-5y) than in long-end (20y+).”

“Auctions in the ultra-long sector show much weaker, less consistent concession patterns.”

2. Post-Auction Behaviour

“Concession often persists for 1–2 days after the auction, especially if the auction tails.”

“When auctions are strong (high bid-to-cover, small tail), concession tends to retrace more quickly post-auction.”

“Persistence is higher in heavy supply weeks, suggesting dealers continue distributing risk after the auction.”

3. Curve Concession

“Bonds being auctioned often cheapen relative to neighbours on the curve, showing that the concession is bond-specific rather than just macro-driven.”

“The curve concession effect is clearest in the 7–10y sector.”

4. ASW Concession

“ASW concession sometimes diverges from outright concession — e.g. bond richening on swaps even while cheapening outright.”

“This suggests dealer hedging flows vs. swap demand play a role, not just outright positioning.”

5. Correlations

“Across auctions, there’s a ~60% correlation between the pre-auction cheapening and F+1 performance.”

“Correlation weakens quickly beyond 3 days post-auction, showing concession is largely a short-term phenomenon.”

“Correlation is stronger in shorts than in longs — indicating more predictable post-auction dynamics in the front end.”

6. Auction Type Differences

“Concessions tend to be larger for reopenings than for new issues.”

“Green gilt auctions show similar pre-auction cheapening, but reversals are faster, suggesting a more stable end-client base.”

🧾 How to Package This

Your “Findings” slide(s) might look like:

Slide 1 – Outright Price Action

Chart: Average 5-day concession vs. post-auction recovery (fan chart).

Bullet: Shorts cheapen more consistently than longs.

Slide 2 – Relative Value (Curve & ASW)

Chart: Example curve concession line plot.

Bullet: Concession is bond-specific, ASW sometimes diverges from outright.

Slide 3 – Persistence & Correlation

Chart: Correlation line plot (P → F days).

Bullet: Pre-auction moves partly predict F+1; effect fades after 3 days.

👉 So, your actual findings are things like:

“Auctions tend to cause gilts to cheapen ahead of time.”

“This effect varies by maturity.”

“Sometimes the cheapening persists, sometimes it snaps back.”

“Outright vs. curve vs. ASW tell different stories about investor flows.”

You don’t need to discover something brand new. The point is to show you can quantify, describe, and communicate the dynamics clearly.
